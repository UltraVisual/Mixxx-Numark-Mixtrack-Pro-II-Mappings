Numark Mixtrack Pro II Mappings
===============================
Some improvements for the Mixtrack Pro II. Please use GitHub's issue tracker
for bugs, thanks.

Put the two files in `~/.mixxx/controllers`.

Everything is as explained in the manual except for the FX buttons becasue
Mixxx only have one effect. FX1 is the flanger and FX2, FX3 and TAP are
high frequency kill, mid frequency kill and low frequency kill.

Press the files knob to change between folder and file mode, back is unused
at the moment.

Beats knob is pregain.

The three knobs on the top left are LFO Intensity, depth and delay. Top
right are unused.

Top row of pads flash when channel clipping occurs (too loud).
